                    <p>It seems like everything in our lives has gone digital, but the way in which we buy, store and wear clothing has barely changed. Sure, many clothes are bought online now, but it is usually impossible to know how those clothes will look or fit without trying them on. Even more so, how do they fit in with the clothes you already own? Do you have enough pieces to mix and match? Wouldn't it be great if there was one system that cataloged your entire inventory of clothing so you knew what you had, what you liked, and what you needed to buy? That is the goal of LookBook. Not only does LookBook take stock of your closet, its smart algorithm shuffles the clothes you already own into outfits that you can "accept" or "reject." This makes the algorithm smarter and makes getting dressed a breeze. <strong>At LookBook we believe that when you look good you feel good.</strong></p>
                    <p>Allison had the idea for LookBook when she was a Senior in college and won a TechStars Startup Weekend Competition for the concept in 2015. However, she was never able to get it off the ground at the time. Now pursuing her MBA at Kellogg, Allison believes there has never been a better time to launch LookBook. The coronavirus pandemic has shuttered nearly all retail stores. People want a better way to shop from home. They often don't know where to start online and they don't want ads for clothes they don't need. Now more than ever, people are trying to be smart about their purchases. LookBook aims to help people reclaim their wardrobe and dress for the life they want.</p>
                    <p>LookBook is <strong>free for shoppers</strong> and <strong>partners with Retailers</strong> to provide data and a platform to advertise their clothes to a more targeted audience.</p>
