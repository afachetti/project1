This website describes a startup idea I have always had and want to pursue in New Venture Discovery next fall. The idea is a "virtual closet." You will have an app to see all the clothes you own and the app will recommend outfits based on your style preferences. This app will be free for users but the business will make money by selling the data and rights to advertise clothes on the platform to retailers.
